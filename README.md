 <li>Write a Turing machine that takes as input a binary number <em>a </em>(a string in “0” and “1”) and outputs <em>a </em>− 1 (in binary). Be careful to specify the alphabet and all instructions.</li>

 <li>Let is a Turing machine.</li>

</ol>

Find a function <em>f </em>: T → N such that if N and M are Turing machines and <em>f</em>(N) = <em>f</em>(M) then N = M (that is, N and M have the same alphabet, same transition function, etc.).
